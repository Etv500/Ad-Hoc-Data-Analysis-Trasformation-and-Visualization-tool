# Ad-Hoc-Data-Analysis-Trasformation-and-Visualization-tool

Before you run the app make sure that:
1)MongoDB server is running (in Windows this can be checked in services)
2)MongoDB environment variable path is set and MongoDB tools have been downloaded and saved into bin folder used for path
3)Paste the three source data CSV files  (add data if you need I just added few sample rows in the CSVs here) into a folder named 'Inputs_and_outputs' that sits in same directory of the Python files, all the output will be saved in this folder when you running the app

Then you can run GUI.py in your IDE or cmd, or run Run.ipynb in Jupyter
